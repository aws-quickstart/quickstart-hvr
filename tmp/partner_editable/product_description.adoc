Use cases for this Quick Start include the following:

* Migrate data between homogeneous environments. For example, you might move data from an on-premises Oracle database to Oracle in the AWS Cloud.
* Migrate data between heterogeneous environments. For example, you might move data from an on-premises Oracle database to Amazon Redshift in the AWS Cloud. In this case, you might migrate gradually and have a fallback option.
* Replicate data. For example, you might move data from various source environments to Amazon Redshift or Snowflake in near-real time.
* Set up analytics and reporting for data lakes, data warehouses, or consolidated databases using multiple AWS services to continuously integrate your data.

In keeping with HVR's recommended best practice for high availability, this Quick Start deploys {partner-product-short-name} in a distributed architecture. The distributed architecture includes two HVR agents that are close to replication endpoints and an HVR hub that controls all replication flows.

This architecture provides the following benefits:

* Performance: It provides local access to data and compressed, optimized communication.
* Scalability: It distributes resource-intensive processing so that you can manage many replication flows through a single control environment.
* Security: It uses encrypted communication and a proxy to avoid opening a firewall directly into a production database.

Supported data sources include commonly used relational databases: Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Db2, PostgreSQL, and others. Destinations include Amazon services such as Amazon Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), as well as many Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)-supported technologies, including Snowflake.

HVR processes communicate over TCP/IP connections using SSL data encryption.
