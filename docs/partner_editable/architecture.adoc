Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following _{partner-product-short-name}_ environment in the
AWS Cloud.

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

In the public subnets:

* An Amazon Linux host to serve as the HVR hub in an Auto Scaling group between availibility zones to allow for high availibility.  This also allows Shell (SSH) access.  In this configuration only one EC2 instance runs at a time.

In the private subnets:

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.
* An Amazon Linux host to serve as HVR remote agents to either capture or apply database transactions to the source or target.  The agents are in an Auto Scaling group where at least two agents are running at a time, one in each Availibility Zone.  Or two in a single AZ if one of the AZs goes down.

* An Aurora Postgres instance in a Multi-AZ configuration to serve as the HVR repository.  Alternately, it can serve as an HVR source or target.

*The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
