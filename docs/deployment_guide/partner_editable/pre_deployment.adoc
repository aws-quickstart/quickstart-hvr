== Predeployment steps

=== Prepare for the deployment

To help secure communication between the HVR components—the HVR hub and agents—this deployment uses a private key and public certificate pair. The template provides a default pair that you can use. Use the default pair for evaluation only; when you deploy this Partner Solution, generate your own pair. You can create these keys (private key and public key) using either OpenSSL or the HVR the *hvrsslgen* command. For details, see the https://www.hvr-software.com/docs/5/commands/hvrsslgen[HVR documentation^].

Before you deploy this Partner Solution, create a Secrets Manager secret. This is a text secret that holds the full HVR license key. During deployment, you are asked to provide the ARN for this secret.
