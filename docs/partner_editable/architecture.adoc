Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** The HVR Hub host (Linux based) in an Auto Scaling group behind a network load balancer.  
Only one HVR Hub instance will be created, with an EFS filesystem attached.  In case of failure, a new HVR Hub host will
be created and attached to the EFS filesystem.
** Two HVR Agent hosts (Linux based) in an Auto Scaling group behind a Network Load Balancer will be created.  
** Optional:  Even though optional, it is recommended to create the Aurora Postgresql database for use as the HVR Hub repository database.

// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* Bastion host - based on HVR BYOL Marketplace Image.
* HVR Hub Instance - based on HVR BYOL Marketplace Image.
* HVR Agent Instances (2) - based on HVR BYOL Marketplace Image.
* Network Load Balancers.
* Secrets Manager secrets - Used for Database and OS User Passwords.
* Secrets Maanger secrets - Used for the HVR Public/Private certificates for secure communication.
* Aurora Postgresql - Database used as HVR Hub Repository.
