This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for [____?] who want to use HVR to replicate data between transactional databases and file systems. The architecture supports real-time change data capture (CDC) and near-real-time replication between technologies in homogeneous or heterogeneous environments. 

//TODO Tony, Please fill in the blank with our target audience. 

Common use cases:

*  Analytics and reporting for data lakes, data warehouses, and consolidated reporting databases, using multiple AWS services to integrate data continuously.
*  Migrating data from on-premises to the AWS Cloud. You may migrate using the same technology for a homogeneous environment, or, for a heterogeneous migration, you may migrate gradually and have a fallback option.

//TODO Tony, How could we state these two use cases more clearly and accurately?

For example, you might choose this Quick Start if you're replicating data in real time between various database environments, such as Oracle to PostgreSQL. Or you might move data in near-real time from various source environments into Amazon Redshift or Snowflake. For details on source and target configuration options supported by HVR, see the https://www.hvr-software.com/docs/5[HVR documentation^] or the https://www.hvr-software.com[HVR Software website^].

//TODO Tony, Please move these examples up into the use-case list so that each use case bullet includes an example.

You can use HVR to get your data-replication project up and running, from creating and loading tables, to [____ing?] log-based CDC, to validating and repairing data, to monitoring.

//TODO Tony, what verb goes in this blank?
