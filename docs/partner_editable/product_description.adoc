Efficient Change Data Capture and near real-time replication between technologies in homogeneous or heterogeneous environments enables several use cases. The most common ones are:

*  Analytics and reporting, building data lakes, data warehouses and consolidated reporting databases leveraging multiple AWS services.
*  High availability, leveraging AWS regions to ensure data is available 24x7.
*  Data migration, between on-premises environments and AWS, either leveraging the same technology or for a heterogeneous migration, with the ability to gradually migrate and have a fallback option.

HVR provides the complete set of features necessary to get your data replication project up and running from beginning to end: table creation and initial load, log-based CDC, data validation and repair, and monitoring.

Supported data sources include commonly-used relational databases such as Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, PostgreSQL, and others. Destinations include an Amazon service like Redshift, RDS or S3, as well as many EC2-supported technologies, including Snowflake.

HVR processes communicate over TPC/IP connections using SSL data encryption. To maximize efficiency run the HVR environment in the same region and availability zone of the target database or service.
