This guide provides instructions for deploying the {partner-product-name} Quick Start reference architecture on the AWS Cloud.

This Quick Start is for organizations that want to use HVR to replicate data between transactional databases and file systems. The architecture supports real-time change data capture (CDC) for databases, analytics, and migrations. It also supports near-real-time replication between technologies in homogeneous or heterogeneous environments. You can use HVR to get your data-replication project up and runningâ€”from creating and loading tables, to using log-based CDC, to validating and repairing data, to monitoring.

For details on source and target configuration options supported by HVR, see the https://www.hvr-software.com/docs/5[HVR documentation^] or the https://www.hvr-software.com[HVR Software website^].
