In keeping with HVR's recommended best practice for high availability, this Quick Start deploys HVR in a distributed architecture. The distributed architecture includes two HVR agents that are close to replication endpoints and an HVR hub that controls all replication flows. This architecture provides the following benefits:

*  Performance: It provides local access to data and compressed, optimized communication.
*  Scalability: It distributes resource-intensive processing so that you can manage many replication flows through a single control environment.
*  Security: It uses encrypted communication and a proxy to avoid opening a firewall directly into a production database.

The HVR hub and agent instances use the HVR BYOL Marketplace image, which has the HVR software and database drivers preinstalled and ready to use with your existing license.

Supported data sources include commonly used relational databases: Oracle, SQL Server, Db2, PostgreSQL, and others. Destinations include Amazon services such as Redshift, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), as well as many EC2-supported technologies, including Snowflake.

HVR processes communicate over TPC/IP connections using SSL data encryption.
